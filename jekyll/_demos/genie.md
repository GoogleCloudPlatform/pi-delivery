  What does Pi sound like? Each Pi digit is converted to a musical note so you
  can get to know Pi via music!

  <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/pianogenie">Piano Genie</a> is an
  neural network model that allows you to play a note from 1 to 8, and
  intelligently map it to a great sounding piano performance. In this demo, we
  use each digit for [0, 7] and reuse the last digit for [8, 9], and use Piano
  Genie to map to the next logical note for great sounding Pi.

<p>
  With 100 trillion digits and playing at 314 BPM, it'll play for 605 516
  years!
