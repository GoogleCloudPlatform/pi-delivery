Doodle](https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-johann-sebastian-bach) to
celebrate world renowned German composer and musician Johann Sebastian Bach. You
can create a melody line and use the AI to fill in the harmony. This demo uses
Pi digits to create the melody, and then you can uses [Google Bach Doodle ML
model (Coconet)](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/coconet) to infill the harmony.
Coconet Javascript library is available as part of
