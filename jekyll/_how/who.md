We are part of the [Google Cloud Platform Developer Advocacy team](https://cloud.google.com/developers/advocates).

Since 2015, different members of the team worked on different Pi Day demos!

In 2022, we updated the backend with [Cloud Functions (2nd gen)](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/2nd-gen/overview) and published the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pi-delivery). We also used Cloud Functions to calculate digits of Pi.

In 2020, we updated the Pi digits to 50 trillion digits, and added Machine Learning models to generate even better Pi music.

In 2019, the Pi digits world record was broken by [Emma Haruka Iwao](https://twitter.com/Yuryu). Google Cloud Experiment for Pi Day was created by [Mathias Paumgarten](https://twitter.com/roboshoes). The Pi API was updated to serve all 31.4+ trillion digits by [Ray Tsang](https://twitter.com/saturnism).

In 2018, the Pi API was updated to serve 1 trillion digits by

In 2017, we made this site and the Pi API, by

In 2016, we calculated 500 billion digits of Pi and made it searchable. The indexing peaked at 2-million writes per second. You can learn more how we did that in the blog <a href="https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/03/calculating-and-searching-500-billion-digits-of-Pi.html" target="_blank">Calculating and searching 500 billion digits of Pi</a>, by
