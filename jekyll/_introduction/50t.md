We are serving 50 trillon digits of pi on this website. You can also [download](http://storage.googleapis.com/pi50t/index.html) the files for yourself if you want to, but beware it's 40 TB!

The digits are kindly donated by the former world record holder [Timothy Mullican](https://blog.timothymullican.com/calculating-pi-my-attempt-breaking-pi-record). He physically shipped the drives to us so that we could store them in Cloud. We received eight disks.

We also had an opportunity to interview Timothy for Pi Day 2020. Check out this video if you want to hear two world record breakers discuss about pi!
