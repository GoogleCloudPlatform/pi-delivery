This website serves pi and interactive demos that you can listen to or see pi with.
Scroll down to play with the demos!

To learn more about how this site works, check out the [Serving the Pi](#howserving) section.
We've also published the entire [source code](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/pi-delivery) of the demos and infrastructure, including Terraform scripts, on GitHub.

This website is not an official Google product. It is managed by volunteers of the [Google Cloud Developer Advocacy team](https://cloud.google.com/developers/advocates) and may go down or shut down without notice.
