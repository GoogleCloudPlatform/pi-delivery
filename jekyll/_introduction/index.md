We've upgraded this website with a modern design! Now the backend runs in [Cloud Functions (2nd gen)](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/2nd-gen/overview) in three regions (US, Europe, Asia). To learn more about the architecture, check out the [Serving the Pi](#howserving) section. We've also published the entire [source code](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/pi-delivery) of the demos and the infrastructure, including Terraform scripts on GitHub.
