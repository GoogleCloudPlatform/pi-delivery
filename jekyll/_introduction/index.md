Records are made to be broken. In March 2022, we calculated 100 trillion digits of pi using [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute). This is the second time weâ€™ve used Google Cloud to calculate a record number of digits for the mathematical constant, tripling the number of digits in just three years after our world record with 31.4 trillion digits in 2019.

Check out the [official blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/calculating-100-trillion-digits-of-pi-on-google-cloud) for more details about the technical details and architecture of the calculation. And for more on the history of calculating pi, check out [this post](https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/new-digit-pi-2022/) on The Keyword.

We've updated the API to serve all of the 100 trillion digits of pi. We've also [published the entire results on Cloud Storage](https://storage.googleapis.com/pi100t/index.html) so you can download the files (caution: they are really big).
